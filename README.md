# NICOs
Nested ICOs Offer a Reverse Bonus Award to The Seller to Help Them Become a Creator.

Imagine a stock exchange IPO followed by a bunch of Nested IPOs. That is NOT what NICOs are.

Nested Initial Coin Offerings enable any cryptoeconomic community to configure value through a combination of synthetic utility and Metcalfe's Law.

The potential future value of any NICO is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the cryptoeconomic system (n2).
